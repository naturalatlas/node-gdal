part ofa mass conversion of US Geological Survey Digital Elevation
model archive to SDTS.  The data organization was changed from a
southwest origin with south to north scans to a northwest origin with
west to east scans.  The x,y grid positions were not altered -- i.e.,
the data was not resampled.  The UTM gridded DEMs are ragged in their
native form.  A fill value was used too make the DEM grid rectangular
in this transfer.


GENERAL NOTES: A number of factors affect gridding processes and the
accuracy of the final DEM product: 1) A dependency exists between the
scale of the source materials and the level of detail or grid
refinement that is possible from a given source.  2) During the
process of changing scale, from large to small, some source data may
be generalized or dropped out and, therefore, some features would not
be available for formation of, or incorporation into, a grid at that
scale.  3) The process of forming a grid with regular spacing requires
the transfer of precise point or vector data to generalized grid
square corners using a process similar to taking a simple weighted
average.  This process may alter the apparent position upon display of
point or vector source data, reducing the ability to recover positions
of specific features whose dimensions are less than the internal grid
cell spacing.  For all DEM's, the grid spacing and spatial resolution
results in data intervals that span terrain discontinuities, such as
benches, tops, and drainage.  Some features can be appropriately
captured at a given grid spacing while other, smaller features are
subdued or filtered out altogether.00092 D 1   00039   21040001080DQHL4580000002DQHL2DEM CELL NAME: OREGON BASIN, WY-2400000108 D 1   00039   21040001080DQHL6180000003DQHL3PROCESS CODE 2: Manual profile GRIDEM simple bilinear00109 D 1   00039   21040001080DQHL6280000004DQHL4DEM PRODUCER:  Mid-Continent Mapping Center, Rolla, MO00066 D 1   00039   21040001080DQHL1980000005DQHL5DEM LEVEL-100351 D 1   00041   310400010080DQHL30280000006DQHL6DEM LEVEL 1 means: DEM created by auto correlation or manual profiling from aerial photographs.

inherent in all collection systems, there will always be some artifacts
such as benches, striations, patches, or some other anomaly that
imparts some signature of the collection system in the data set.  Some
of these artifacts, although falling within normal DEM vertical error
tolerances, can coalesce with valid surface features. All DEM's are
viewed and edited so corrective actions can be taken to minimize these
artifacts. For example, 1) Isolated tops are depicted with their
approximate size and shape; 2) Flat trending surfaces are depicted as
generally flat trending without confusing patterns or striations; and,
3) Water bodies are flat, lower than the surrounding terrain, and have
shorelines clearly delineated.  Additional testing is performed using
a DEM Editing System (DES) to aid in the identification of blunders
such as irregularly gridded data, mistagging of tops and depressions,
and spikes.  These blunders are generally identified by displaying the
DEM with the aid of DES options, which include color banding of
elevation gradients, stereoscopic viewing using anaglyphic filters,
and shaded-relief enhancement.  An elevation matrix is analyzed in
suspect areas and corrected as required.
